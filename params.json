The emphasis is on discovery by the user rather than instruction from the program.\r\n\r\n##Summary\r\n\r\nThe program has 3 main parts: keyboard, text response, and visualization.\r\n\r\nThe keyboard and scale provide the first response to input: when a key is pressed, it lights up on the screen on its key and note. The next response is the visualization box. This is the main visual response for our program. As the user plays notes, intervals, chords, and scales the visual response provides a dynamic animation based on what is being played (think a windows media player \"visualization\"). When a chord or scale is played the visualization changes, providing a positive response to the user \"discovering\" a chord.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n* Scale to show note on a staff\r\n* Dynamic goals frame to provide user with direction\r\n* Press a button to learn about the chord last played.\r\n* MIDI controller support\r\n* Text response gives notes, intervals, chords, and scales\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* Python 2.\r\n* Pygame\r\n* No prior musical abilities!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
